# agent-desktop

agent-desktop is a CLI that lets an AI agent observe and operate desktop apps through the OS accessibility tree. It is a tool, not an agent. Every command prints one JSON envelope (`ok`, `data` or `error`). The observe, act and verify loop runs in you.

## Shell syntax

Examples use a POSIX shell. In PowerShell, quote every ref (`'@s8f3k2p9:e1'`), because a bare `@token` is the splatting operator. Use `$env:NAME = 'value'` instead of `export`, and `| ConvertFrom-Json` instead of `$(...)` and `jq`. The Windows skill has the PowerShell forms.

## First run

1. Run `agent-desktop status`. It reports the platform, permissions and `supported_surfaces`.
2. Run `agent-desktop skills get platform`. It loads the skill for the OS the binary runs on (macOS, Windows or Linux).
3. For flags and syntax, run `agent-desktop <command> --help`. This skill does not repeat flag lists.

## The loop

Use `find` when you know the role or exact name. Otherwise map the app first and drill into one region.

```
agent-desktop snapshot --skeleton --app "Notes" -i --compact   # shallow map, children_count on cut branches
agent-desktop snapshot --root @s8f3k2p9:e3 -i --compact        # drill into one region
agent-desktop click @s8f3k2p9:e12                              # act on a qualified ref
agent-desktop snapshot --root @s8f3k2p9:e3 -i --compact        # verify: re-read the same region
```

- A small app needs no skeleton. Take a full `snapshot -i`.
- Never skeleton a surface (`--surface menu`, `sheet`, `alert`). A surface is already focused.
- An action that opens a menu, sheet or alert lists it in `data.surfaces`. Target that overlay next.
- After an async step, use `wait` (see `commands-system.md`). A fixed sleep is a race.

## Refs

- Output refs are qualified: `@<snapshot_id>:e<N>`, for example `@s8f3k2p9:e1`. Pass them to later commands as they are.
- Refs are valid for one snapshot. After any UI change, re-drill the affected region or take a new snapshot.
- Only addressable elements get refs. Static text and inert containers do not.
- `STALE_REF`: the ref no longer matches the live UI. Take a fresh snapshot and use the new ref.
- `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`: more than one live element matches. Narrow the target with `find --role --name --exact` or `--root`, then use the new ref.
- `SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND`: the snapshot id expired. Snapshot again.

## Delivery and retry

Action results carry `data.disposition` and errors carry `error.disposition`, each with `delivery` and `retry`. Observation commands such as `snapshot` have none on success; their errors, and every `INVALID_ARGS` refusal, carry `not_delivered` and `retry: safe`.

- Retry or substitute an action only when `disposition.retry` is `safe`. Only `not_delivered` is safe.
- Any other delivery value means the action may have landed. A repeat can click, type or submit twice, and `toggle` can undo itself.
- On a result that is not safe, read the live state (`get`, `is`, or a fresh snapshot) and decide from that. `details.post_state` helps when present.
- Branch on `error.code` and `error.disposition`. Message and suggestion text can change.
- `details.retryable: false` means waiting cannot change the outcome. Try a different approach.

## Headless and headed

Ref actions are headless by default. They use semantic accessibility calls and do not take focus, move the cursor, synthesize keys or use the clipboard. If no semantic path exists, the action fails closed. Use the global `--headed` flag only when the user explicitly permits physical input, such as double-click, hover, drag, or focus. Never switch to headed mode to recover from a headless failure. Raw coordinates (`--xy`) never imply focus. Which actions need `--headed` differs by OS: read the platform skill.

## References

Load one only when you need it: `agent-desktop skills get desktop <reference>`.

| Reference | Open it when |
|-----------|--------------|
| `commands-observation` | You need `snapshot`, `find`, `get`, `is`, `screenshot`, `list-surfaces` semantics, partial trees, or the `--root` rules |
| `commands-interaction` | You choose between click, type, set-value, select, toggle, scroll, press and mouse commands, or you debug an action error |
| `commands-system` | You launch or close apps, manage windows, use the clipboard, `wait`, `batch`, sessions, multi-agent cursors, tracing, or load skills |
| `workflows` | You want worked patterns (forms, menus, dialogs, waiting for a new window, scroll-find, drag) and the anti-patterns list |

## agent-desktop-windows

The observe-act loop, ref system, JSON envelope, sessions and tracing are the
same on every platform. This file covers only what differs on Windows.

Requires Windows 10 1809+ / Windows Server 2019+ (x64 or ARM64). Run it in the
interactive desktop session of the signed-in user. Session 0 (services and
SYSTEM tasks), Server Core, the secure desktop (UAC prompts, the sign-in
screen), a locked desktop and another user's session are not supported:
observation, actions and capture there fail or return nothing.

### Capability Table

| Group | Commands | Status on Windows |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Observation | `snapshot`, `find`, `get`, `is`, `screenshot` | Works. Surfaces are `window`, `focused`, a Chromium modal as `sheet`, and an open application menu as `menu` |
| Surfaces | `list-surfaces` | Works. Lists `window`, `focused` and `sheet` per process, plus `menu` with `item_count` while a menu is open |
| Shell surfaces | `open-system-surface` | Works for `start-menu`, `taskbar`, `system-tray`, `system-tray-overflow` and `action-center`, and returns the window `snapshot --surface <kind>` reads. `quick-settings` returns `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` naming `action-center` |
| Ref interaction | `click`, `right-click`, `type`, `set-value`, `clear`, `select`, `toggle`, `check`, `uncheck`, `expand`, `collapse`, `scroll`, `scroll-to` | Works, semantic in headless and `--headed` mode. `right-click` and `type` need `--headed` and return `POLICY_DENIED` headless |
| Multi-click and focus | `double-click`, `triple-click`, `focus` | Works with global `--headed` only |
| Keyboard and mouse | `press`, `hover`, `drag`, `mouse-click`, `mouse-move`, `mouse-wheel` | Works. Cursor-moving input needs `--headed`. First Contact covers `press --app` |
| Held input | `key-down`, `key-up`, `mouse-down`, `mouse-up` | Fails closed on every platform with `ACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED`. A headless `mouse-down` or `mouse-up` returns `POLICY_DENIED` first |
| App and window | `launch`, `close-app`, `list-windows`, `list-apps`, `focus-window`, `resize-window`, `move-window`, `minimize`, `maximize`, `restore` | Works. First Contact covers the name `launch` takes |
| Displays | `list-displays` | Works |
| Clipboard | `clipboard-get`, `clipboard-set`, `clipboard-clear` | Works; typed text and image content |
| Wait | `wait` | Works for ms, `--element`, `--window`, `--text`, `--menu`, `--menu-closed`, `--event` and `--notification` |
| Notifications | `list-notifications`, `dismiss-notification`, `dismiss-all-notifications`, `notification-action` | Works over the Action Center. Pass `--headed` when the center is closed |
| Cursor overlay | `cursor-overlay` | Works. `enable` returns `data.rendered: true` only after the renderer acknowledges over its pipe. See `references/shell-and-overlay.md` |
| System | `status`, `permissions`, `version`, `batch`, `skills`, `session`, `trace` | Works |

### First Contact

- **Quote every ref in PowerShell.** PowerShell reads a bare `@token` as its
  splatting operator and deletes the argument before the binary sees it, so
  `set-value @s8f3k2p9:e1 hi` fails `INVALID_ARGS`. Write
  `set-value '@s8f3k2p9:e1' hi`. cmd.exe and bash need no quoting.
- **A window behind another window is drivable. A minimized one is not.**
  Every element of a minimized window reports `offscreen` and ref actions
  fail. Run `restore --app <image>` and snapshot again. Do not use
  `focus-window` by reflex: it steals the user's foreground.
- **No permission dialog exists.** `permissions` reports `automation` as
  `not_required`. Elevation boundaries are the only access control.
- **Chromium and Electron apps read thin before they settle.** Pass a longer
  `--timeout-ms` to `snapshot` instead of concluding the tree is empty.
- **Blocked shortcuts.** `alt+f4`, `win+l`, `win+d`, `alt+tab`, `win+r`,
  `win+x`, `win+e`, `ctrl+shift+esc` and their modifier supersets are refused
  without `--force`. In combos, `cmd` and `meta` are the Windows key, so
  `meta+c` is a shell shortcut. Write `ctrl+c` to copy.
- **`type` needs `--headed`.** It is keystroke synthesis through `SendInput`,
  so a strict-headless `type` returns `POLICY_DENIED`. Use `set-value`, or pass
  `--headed`. It ends `delivered_unverified` (`verification_scope:
  "unavailable"`) when the field exposes no readable Text selection, and can
  verify when one is readable: confirm with a fresh `get`.
- **`press --app` writes to the foreground queue** with no per-process
  targeting. A headless press to a non-frontmost app fails closed. A
  non-interactive caller (service, scheduled task, CI job) gets
  `delivered_unverified`.
- **`launch` takes an absolute path or a bare name** under System32 or the
  Windows directory, with or without `.exe` (`notepad` or `notepad.exe`), not
  a display name. Use `list-apps` to find a running app.
- **Notifications:** `list-notifications` with the Action Center closed needs
  `--headed`. Single-item `dismiss-notification` and `notification-action` need
  `--headed` and `--expected-app` or `--expected-title` for the entry at INDEX.
- **Surfaces:** an open or context menu is the `menu` surface. Windows does
  not advertise a `menubar` surface.
- **Commands that raise shell chrome take the foreground.** Strict headless
  refuses them with `POLICY_DENIED` before anything is raised.
- **Stateful actions run once, then verify by re-reading.** `delivered_verified`
  means the readback matched. `ACTION_FAILED` with
  `details.kind: "post_action_verification"` means the action landed but the
  readback differs: read `details.post_state` and do not retry. A `set-value`
  the app reformats reads as failed. See `references/troubleshooting.md`.
- **Unsigned binary warnings are expected.** See `references/troubleshooting.md`.

### What differs on Windows

- Ref actions are semantic UI Automation calls in headless and `--headed` mode, except `right-click`, `double-click`, `triple-click`, `type` and `focus`, which are physical or take focus and need `--headed`.
- The cursor overlay plays its per-action travel only for headless semantic actions. A `--headed` action moves the real cursor instead.
